    "Id": 1,
    "Name": "Ability Damaged",
    "Description": "The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ability score points. If, during a 24-hour period, a creature gets a full 8 hours of sleep or equivalent rest (depending on the creature's race), that creature recovers 1 ability score point per damaged ability score. Any significant interruption, such as combat, during the rest prevents healing. Complete bed rest for the entire 24 hours doubles this rate. Undertaking even light activity during a 24-hour period prevents this additional healing. \n\nSomeone who has the Heal skill can help another creature double its recovery of ability score points by succeeding on a DC 15 Heal check. A healer can tend up to six patients. Providing this sort of care is light activity and requires medical supplies. You can?t give longterm care to yourself.\n\nA character with Strength 0 falls to the ground and is helpless. A character with Dexterity 0 is paralyzed. A character with Constitution 0 is dead. A character with Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 0 is unconscious. Ability damage is different from penalties to ability scores, which go away when the conditions causing them go away."

    "Name": "Blinded",
    "Description": "A blinded creature can't see. It takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, moves at half speed, and takes a -4 penalty on Search checks and on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and Spot checks) fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment against the blinded creature. A blinded creature pinpoints targets and deals damage to them as if those targets were invisible. Blinded creatures are immune to gaze attacks and other attacks that require the target to be able to see in order to be affected."

    "Id": 4,
    "Name": "Blown Away",
    "Description": "Depending on its size, a creature can be blown away by winds of high velocity. Each round a creature on the ground that is blown away is knocked down and rolls 1d4  10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. In each round when a flying creature is blown away, it is blown back 2d6  10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffering."

    "Name": "Confused",
    "Description": "A confused creature's activities are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn: 01-10, attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attacking isn't possible); 11-20, act normally; 21-50, do nothing but babble incoherently; 51-70, flee away from caster at top possible speed; 71-100, attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject?s self). A confused character that can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers gain no special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character that is attacked always retaliates against its attackers on its next turn, as long as it's still confused when its turn comes. A confused creature doesn't make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it isn't already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent attack or because it has just been attacked)."

    "Description": "A creature becomes dead when its current hit points are reduced to -10, its Constitution drops to 0, or it's killed outright by massive damage or some other death-dealing effect. The creature's soul leaves its body. Dead creatures can't benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life by magic. When spellcasters die, all prepared spells stored in their mind are wiped away. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead creature to life also restores the body to some degree."

A disabled creature can take a single move action or standard action each round, but not both. It can't take full-round actions. It moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn?t cause further injury, but performing any standard action, or any other act the DM deems strenuous, deals 1 point of damage after the completion of that act. Unless the act increased the disabled creature's hit points, it now has negative hit points and is dying.\n\nCreatures that are not living (such as constructs, undead, and death less) are destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points."

    "Id": 14,
    "Name": "Dying",
    "Description": "A dying creature has -1 to -9 current hit points. It's unconscious and can take no actions.

It has a 10% chance to become stable. If not, it loses 1 hit point. If a dying creature reaches -10 hit points, it's dead."
  },
  {
    "Id": 15,
    "Name": "Energy Drained",
    "Description": "The character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain the character's levels. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies.

Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at a fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect.

Frightened creatures can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, a frightened creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
